# Statistical Analysis of U.S. City Precipitation Data Using R

This repository contains an R-based statistical analysis project using the built-in `precip` dataset, which records annual precipitation levels (in inches) for 70 U.S. cities.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Environment

* **Language:** R
* **Platform:** Google colab
* **Dataset:** `precip` (built-in dataset from base R)

## ðŸ”§ R Objects and Functions Used

* `precip`: Numeric vector containing precipitation data
* `stem()`: Generates a stem-and-leaf plot
* `summary()`: Provides descriptive statistics
* `fivenum()`: Calculates Tukey's five-number summary
* `var()`, `sd()`: Compute variance and standard deviation
* `boxplot()`: Draws a box-and-whisker plot
* `qqnorm()`, `qqline()`: Create a Q-Q plot for normality assessment

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

* Stem-and-leaf plot for distribution insights
* Boxplot for identifying spread and potential outliers
* Q-Q plot for evaluating normality of the data
